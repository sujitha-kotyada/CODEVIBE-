## Style Guide

### JavaScript/React
```javascript
// Use const by default, let when needed
const username = 'John';

// Use arrow functions
const handleClick = () => {
  // implementation
};

// Component naming - PascalCase
function UserProfile() {
  return <div>Profile</div>;
}

// Variable/function naming - camelCase
const userData = {};
const fetchUserData = () => {};

// Use destructuring
const { name, email } = user;

// Template literals for strings
const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

### CSS
```css
/* Use meaningful class names */
.course-card {
  /* properties */
}

/* Avoid inline styles */
/* Use CSS variables */
.container {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}

/* Organize properties logically */
.card {
  /* Layout properties */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  
  /* Spacing */
  margin: 1rem;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  
  /* Visual properties */
  background: white;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

### Comments
```javascript
// Single line comment for code explanation
const result = calculateTotal(); // explains what this does

/**
 * Multi-line comment for functions
 * @param {string} name - User name
 * @returns {object} User data
 */
function getUserData(name) {
  // implementation
}
```
